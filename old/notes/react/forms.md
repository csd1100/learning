# Forms using React

- `<form>`s when submitted refresh the page by default.
- We can use `event.preventDefault()` on submit to prevent default browser
  behavior of reload.
- `action` attribute on `<form>` is used to decide where request should be sent.
- Default form submit method is `GET`. And input values are added to URL as
  query params.
- `method` attribute on `<form>` can be used to change submit method from `GET`
  to `POST`. `DIALOG` also valid `method` value.
- `encType` prop on `<form>` can be used to change `Content-Type` to
  `multipart/form-data`. This is used for file uploads.

- `<input>` tag with `type` attribute can be used to receive user input in `<form>`.
- For radio buttons (`type="radio"`) we have to set value of the `name` attributes
  **same** on radio options in order to achieve toggling behavior.
- `<input>` of type `hidden` can be used to submit a value without user input.
  e.g. CSRF token.
- `accept` attribute / prop on `<input>` can be used to limit the type of input.
  e.g. In below example the file input is limited to images using MIME type specified
  in `accept`.
  ```html
  <div>
    <input name="photo" type="file" accept="image/*" />
  </div>
  ```
- In `FormData`, a checked checkbox input is stored as string `on` and if **not**
  checked it just won't appear.
- When `<label>` is associated with `<input>` either by `htmlFor` or being parent
  of that `<input>`, clicking on `<label>` will change focus to input field.
- `htmlFor` is used for `<label>` attribute `for` as it is reserved javascript
  keyword.
- `<select>` and `<option>` elements are used to create selection list.
- `value` attribute on `<option>` is used to define what value should be submitted.
- Order of `<option>`s inside `<select>` matters. As First `<option>` is default
  value.
- `<fieldset>` is used to group form elements together. e.g. radio buttons.
- `<legend>` tag is used with `<fieldset>` to give it a label.

- We can use `defaultValue`|`defaultChecked` prop in React (not part of HTML spec)
  to set default value. The value passed to `defaultValue` is coerced / type casted
  to `string` so do not pass in a object that does not have valid string representation.
- We use `onChange` event in react for handling the change in the value of `<input>`.
- React does things like setting `method`, `encType`, preventing default for us.
  We do not have to do these things manually when using react.  
  When the `action` prop for `<form>` in jsx is assigned to a function, React will
  call that function with data in the form with object of type `FormData` as argument.
  We can do whatever we want with data in that function. React will also reset the
  data in the form to default values.
