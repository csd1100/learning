-> arrays have contiguous memeory location and have fixed size
-> array variable for most language store location of 1st element
-> List and arrays are different
-> get data of array at index = starting location of the array + (index where to insert the data * size of the data); similar for set and delete
-> insertion in array overwrites previous data
-> Deletion means setting to zero or whatever is null value for that context
-> array operations have O(1) (constant) time complexity
-> Arrays needs to have size at it's allocation
