# Ansible modules

\* - Always prefer specific module over this to do something.

- `ansible.builtin.command`<sup>\*</sup>

  - Useful to run commands on hosts without shell and piping outputs doesn't work.

- `ansible.builtin.shell`<sup>\*</sup>

  - Useful to run command using shell, piping works.

- `ansible.builtin.raw`<sup>\*</sup>

  - Useful to run commands without python installed.
  - All modules use python so if python is not installed then use this to run command.

- `ansible.builtin.package`<sup>\*</sup>

  - Useful to install packages on all distros.
  - But it's always better to use specific module than generic.

- `ansible.builtin.assert`

  - Can be used to assert conditions.
  - We can use it to display failure and success message.
  - e.g.

  ```yaml
  ---
  - name: assert
    hosts: localhost
    vars_prompt:
      - name: filesize
        prompt: "specify filesize"
        private: no
    tasks:
      - name: assert something
        assert:
          that:
            # convert filesize to int
            - { { ( filesize | int ) <= 100 } }
            - { { ( filesize | int ) >= 1 } }
          fail_msg: "file size must be between 1 - 100"
          success_msg: "file size is good creating a file"
      - name: "create the file of size {{ filesize }}"
        command: dd if=/dev/zero of=/bigfile bs=1 count={{ filesize }}
  ```

- `ansible.builtin.copy`

  - Copy from controlled host to managed hosts.
  - Can be also used to copy content from file.
  - e.g.

  ```yaml
  # just the task
  - name: Copy file
    ansible.builtin.copy:
      # on control host
      src: /etc/hosts
      # on managed host
      dest: /tmp/
  ```

- `ansible.posix.synchronize`

  - Requires `rsync` to be installed.
  - Efficient than `ansible.builtin.copy` for copying large number of files.

- `ansible.builtin.fetch`

  - Copy from managed host to controlled host.
  - By default store files in `<hostname>/path/to/file` path.

  ```yaml
  - name: fetch file
    ansible.builtin.fetch:
      # on managed host
      src: /tmp/hosts
      # on controll host at path /tmp/<hostname>/tmp/hosts
      dest: /tmp/
  ```

- `ansible.builtin.replace`

  - Can be used to replace text using regex.

- `ansible.builtin.lineinfile`

  - Add single line to file.

- `ansible.builtin.blockinfile`

  - Add multiple line to file.
  - e.g.

  ```yaml
  - name: add lines to file
    ansible.builtin.blockinfile:
      path: /tmp/hosts
      # using | for layout
      block: |
        192.168.74.123 host.example.com
      state: present
  ```

- `ansible.builtin.stat`
  - Information about a file.
  - e.g.
  ```yaml
  - name: get MD5 sum of file
    ansible.builtin.stat:
      path: /tmp/hosts
      checksum_algorithm: md5
      register: result
  - name: print MD5 sum of file
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      var: result.stat.checksum
  ```
- `ansible.builtin.find`
  - Find files and similar to linux find.
  - e.g.
  ```yaml
  - name: find ansible.cfg files
    find:
      paths: /home/ansible/rhce8-live
      patterns: "ansible.cfg"
      recurse: yes
    register: output
  - debug:
      var: item.path
    with_items: "{{ output.files }}"
  - blockinfile:
      path: "{{ item.path }}"
      insertafter: "defaults"
      marker: "##<!-- {mark} ANSIBLE MANAGED BLOCK -->##"
      block: |
        fact_caching = redis
        fact_caching_timeout = 3600
        fact_caching_connection = localhost:6379:0
    with_items: "{{ output.files }}"
  ```
- `ansible.builtin.template`
  - Ansible uses jinja2 template files
  - The templates used by playbooks are stored in `templates` directory.
  - template: location - `./templates/template.j2`
  ```jinja2
  Running on {{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}
  ```
  - playbook:
  ```yaml
  - name: install motd
    template:
      src: template.j2
      dest: /etc/motd
      owner: root
      group: root
      mode: 0644
  ```
